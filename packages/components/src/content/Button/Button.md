# Button

Buttons communicate the action that will occur when the user clicks them. They make actions immediately visible.

## When to use

When you want to communicate an action to a user. There are a number of types to change the appearance of a button. Here is a list of when to use them:

- **Primary** - Used for the most important actions in any scenario. Donâ€™t use more than one primary button in a section or screen to avoid overwhelming users.
- **Muted** - Used for a secondary actions, the most commonly used button type.
- **Positive** - For use when the action has a positive connotation such as creating or publishing a new entity.
- **Negative** - For destructive actions - when something can't be undone. For example, deleting entities.

## Best practices

- Use clear, succinct, and accurate labels
- Start button labels with verbs, for example "Add field", not "New field"
- Position buttons in consistent places in the interface
- Reduce complexity by using a small number of actions. Too many actions can create confusion when having to decide
