## Default

Wrap some content in the outer .blankslate wrapper to give it the blankslate appearance.

## With Octicons

When it helps the message, include (relevant) icons in your blank slate. Add .blankslate-icon to any .mega-octicons as the first elements in the blankslate, like so.

## Narrow

Narrows the blankslate container to not occupy the entire available width.

## Capped

Removes the border-radius on the top corners.

## Spacious

Significantly increases the vertical padding.

## Large

Increases the size of the text in the blankslate

## No background

Removes the background-color and border.
