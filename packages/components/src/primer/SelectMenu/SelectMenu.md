# Select Menu

- Basic

> The SelectMenu component provides advanced support for navigation, filtering, and more. Any menu can make use of JavaScript-enabled live filtering, selected states, tabbed lists, and keyboard navigation with a bit of markup.

## Basic

Use a `<details>` element to toggle the select menu. The `<summary>` element can be styled in many ways. In the example below it's a .btn.
