    ï¹˜ Gitflow utilizes the core feature of Git, which is the power of branches. In this model, a repository has two main branches:
  </div>
  <div>
    ï¹˜ 
    <strong>
      Master
    </strong>
     This is a highly stable branch that is always production-ready and contains the last release version of source code in production.
  </div>
  <div>
    ï¹˜ 
    <strong>
      Develop
    </strong>
     Derived from the master branch, the development branch serves as a branch for integrating different features planned for an upcoming release. This branch may or may not be as stable as the master branch. It is where developers collaborate and merge feature branches.

    ï¹˜ Gitflow Workflow is a Git workflow design that was first published and made popular by Vincent Driessen at nvie. The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. This provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.
  </div>
  <div>
    ï¹˜ Gitflow is ideally suited for projects that have a scheduled release cycle. This workflow doesnâ€™t add any new concepts or commands beyond whatâ€™s required for the Feature Branch Workflow. Instead, it assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact. In addition to feature branches, it uses individual branches for preparing, maintaining, and recording releases. Of course, you also get to leverage all the benefits of the Feature Branch Workflow: pull requests, isolated experiments, and more efficient collaboration.

  </h5>
  <div>
    ï¹˜ This model was conceived in 2010, now more than 10 years ago, and not very long after Git itself came into being. In those 10 years, git-flow (the branching model laid out in this article) has become hugely popular in many a software team to the point where people have started treating it like a standard of sorts â€” but unfortunately also as a dogma or panacea.
