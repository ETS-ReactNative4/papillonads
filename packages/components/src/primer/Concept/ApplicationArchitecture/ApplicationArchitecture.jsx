      </h4>
      <div>
        ï¹˜ Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. (Not to be confused with a WordPress framework â€“ Redux Framework.)
      </div>
      <div>
        ï¹˜ It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are
        easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling
        debugger.
      </div>
      <div>
        ï¹˜ You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large
        ecosystem of addons available.

      <div>
        ï¹˜ This is the official style guide for writing Redux code. It lists our recommended patterns, best practices, and suggested
        approaches for writing Redux applications.
      </div>
      <div>
        ï¹˜ Both the Redux core library and most of the Redux documentation are unopinionated. There are many ways to use Redux, and much of
        the time there is no single &quot;right&quot; way to do things
      </div>
      <div>
        ï¹˜ However, time and experience have shown that for some topics, certain approaches work better than others. In addition, many
        developers have asked us to provide official guidance to reduce decision fatigue.
      </div>
      <div>
        ï¹˜ With that in mind, we&apos;ve put together this list of recommendations to help you avoid errors, bikeshedding, and
        anti-patterns. We also understand that team preferences vary and different projects have different requirements, so no style guide
        will fit all sizes. You are encouraged to follow these recommendations, but take the time to evaluate your own situation and decide
        if they fit your needs.

      <div>
        ï¹˜ Flux is a pattern for managing data flow in your application. The most important concept is that data flows in one direction. As
        we go through this guide we&apos;ll talk about the different pieces of a Flux application and show how they form unidirectional
        cycles that data can flow through.

      </h4>
      <div>
        ï¹˜ React Redux is the official React binding for Redux. It lets your React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch
        actions to the store to update data.
      </div>
      <div>ï¹˜ React Redux provides &apos;Provider&apos;, which makes the Redux store available to the rest of your app:</div>
      <div>ï¹˜ React Redux provides a connect function for you to connect your component to the store.</div>
      <h4>
        <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk">ðŸ“ƒ. Thunk middleware for Redux</a>
      </h4>
      <div>
        ï¹˜With a plain basic Redux store, you can only do simple synchronous updates by dispatching an action. Middleware extend the
        store&apos;s abilities, and let you write async logic that interacts with the store.
      </div>
      <div>
        ï¹˜ Thunks are the recommended middleware for basic Redux side effects logic, including complex synchronous logic that needs access
        to the store, and simple async logic like AJAX requests.
      </div>
      <div>
        ï¹˜ Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to
        delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods
        dispatch and getState as parameters.
      </div>
      <div>ï¹˜ An action creator that returns a function to perform asynchronous dispatch</div>
      <div>ï¹˜ A thunk is a function that wraps an expression to delay its evaluation.</div>
      <div>
        ï¹˜ Any return value from the inner function will be available as the return value of dispatch itself. This is convenient for
        orchestrating an asynchronous control flow with thunk action creators dispatching each other and returning Promises to wait for each
        otherâ€™s completion.
      </div>
      <div>ï¹˜ Since 2.1.0, Redux Thunk supports injecting a custom argument using the withExtraArgument function.</div>

      <div>
        ï¹˜<strong>predicate:</strong> If specified this function will be called before each action is processed with this middleware.
      </div>
      <div>
        ï¹˜<strong>collapsed:</strong> Takes a Boolean or optionally a Function that receives `getState` function for accessing current store
        state and `action` object as parameters. Returns `true` if the log group should be collapsed, `false` otherwise.
      </div>
      <div>
        ï¹˜<strong>duration = false: Boolean:</strong> Print the duration of each action?
      </div>
      <div>
        ï¹˜<strong>timestamp = true: Boolean:</strong> Print the timestamp with each action?
      </div>

      </div>
      <div>
        ï¹˜<strong>titleFormatter:</strong> Format the title used when logging actions.

          ðŸ“ƒ. A mock store for testing Redux async action creators and middleware
        </a>
      </h4>
      <div>
        ï¹˜A mock store for testing Redux async action creators and middleware. The mock store will create an array of dispatched actions
        which serve as an action log for tests.
      </div>
      <div>
        ï¹˜Please note that this library is designed to test the action-related logic, not the reducer-related one. In other words, it does
        not update the Redux store. If you want a complex test combining actions and reducers together, take a look at other libraries
        (e.g., redux-actions-assertions). Refer to issue #71 for more details.
      </div>
      <div>
        ï¹˜<strong>Synchronous actions:</strong> The simplest usecase is for synchronous actions. In this example, we will test if the
        addTodo action returns the right payload. redux-mock-store saves all the dispatched actions inside the store instance. You can get
        all the actions by calling store.getActions(). Finally, you can use any assertion library to test the payload.
      </div>
      <div>
        ï¹˜<strong>Asynchronous actions</strong> A common usecase for an asynchronous action is a HTTP request to a server. In order to test
        those types of actions, you will need to call store.getActions() at the end of the request.
