      ï¹˜ Axe is the Worldâ€™s most popular accessibility testing toolkit built on the Worldâ€™s most popular accessibility rules library. Axe is ideal for development teams to test their Web or Android applications to help identify and resolve common accessibility issues. Built to scale with your needs, users have run axe for everything from ad-hoc single page tests to testing hundreds of thousands of pages while integrated into existing CI/CD processes. Itâ€™s simple to use, doesnâ€™t require advanced accessibility knowledge and wonâ€™t waste your time with false positives.

    <div>
      ï¹˜ Ryan Florence built out this awesome runtime-analysis tool called react-a11y. It is super useful. However, since you're probably already using linting in your project, this plugin comes for free and closer to the actual development process. Pairing this plugin with an editor lint plugin, you can bake accessibility standards into your application in real-time.
    </div>
    <div>
      ï¹˜ Note: This project does not replace react-a11y, but can and should be used in conjunction with it. Static analysis tools cannot determine values of variables that are being placed in props before runtime, so linting will not fail if that value is undefined and/or does not pass the lint rule.

    <div>
      ï¹˜ Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11yâ€”as in "a" then 11 characters then "y") in Web development means enabling as many people as possible to use Web sites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way.
    </div>
    <div>
      ï¹˜ For many people, technology makes things easier. For people with disabilities, technology makes things possible. Accessibility means developing content to be as accessible as possible no matter an individual's physical and cognitive abilities and no matter how they access the web.
    </div>
    <div>
      ï¹˜ The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, culture, location, or physical or mental ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.

    </div>
    <div>
      ï¹˜ Thus the impact of disability is radically changed on the Web because the Web removes barriers to communication and interaction that many people face in the physical world. However, when web sites, applications, technologies, or tools are badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people from using the Web.
    </div>
    <div>
      ï¹˜ Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services.
    </div>
    <div>
      ï¹˜ The mission of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is to lead the Web to its full potential to be accessible, enabling people with disabilities to participate equally on the Web.
