# Subhead

- Plain Subhead
- Spacious Subhead

> The basic Subhead consists of a .Subhead container, which has a light gray bottom border. Use .Subhead-heading for the heading itself. It's an `<h2>` sized heading with normal font-weight.

## Plain Subhead

Use a heading element whenever possible as they can be used as navigation for assistive technologies, and avoid skipping levels.

## Spacious Subhead

To add a top margin to the Subhead, use .Subhead--spacious. This is useful for separating sections on a settings page.
