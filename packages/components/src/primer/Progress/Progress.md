# Progress

- Default
- Large
- Small

> Use progress components to visualize task completion. The Progress class adds a background color and aligns its children horizontally with flexbox. The children (Progress-item) should be individually colored with background utilities and sized with inline width styles in percentages. Overflow is hidden, so children that overflow will be clipped.
